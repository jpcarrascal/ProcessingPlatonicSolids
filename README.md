# ProcessingPlatonicSolids
Platonic Solids for Processing.
A set of Processing classes implementing the five Platonic Solids, with the added possibility of drawing polyhedra vertices with custom radius (an example sketch is included).

Based on the Icosahedron for Processing by Ira Greenberg (https://processing.org/examples/icosahedra.html), and with a little help from the Processing Forum (https://www.processing.org/discourse/beta/num_1272064104.html).

These are some examples of what you can do with this class:
