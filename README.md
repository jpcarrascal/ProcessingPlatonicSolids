# ProcessingPlatonicSolids
A class implementing the Platonic Solids in Processing.

Based on the Icosahedron for Processing by Ira Greenberg (https://processing.org/examples/icosahedra.html).

An implementation of the five Platonic Solids, with the additional possibility of drawing polihedra vertices with custom radius.

These are some examples of what you can do (from the included sample sketch):
